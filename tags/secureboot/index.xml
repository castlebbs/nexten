      <description>Understanding Secure Boot ESP32 series (Part 1) This article is part of a series on the Security Features of the Espressif ESP32 microcontroller series. This includes MCUs based on the Xtensa Instruction Set (e.g. ESP32, ESP32-S3), as well as MCUs based on the RISC-V Instruction Set (e.g. ESP32-C3). This is the first article of the series, which will cover:
Secure Boot V1 (AES Based Secure Boot) (this article) Secure Boot V2 (RSA Based Secure Boot) Flash encryption (AES-XTS and legacy) AES, SHA, RSA, DS and HMAC accelerators World Controller to allow isolated execution environments Introduction ESP32 SoCs are very popular System On a Chip (SoC) microcontrollers made by the company Espressif.</description>
